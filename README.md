🔍 About Me

Systems engineer and technical program leader pivoting to hands-on software engineering, bringing 17 years of architecting and delivering safety-critical defense systems in civilian service for the U.S. Air Force. Active open-source contributor to Microsoft’s Agent Framework. Currently building production-focused projects in Modern C++20, Rust, and Python — including a persistent LSM-Tree storage engine (LokiKV) and probabilistic AI safety frameworks using Split Conformal Prediction. Deep expertise in distributed systems, HPC infrastructure, and navigating strict regulatory environments where failure isn’t an option. Active Top Secret clearance.



Technical Note: All engineering prototypes and code repositories featured on this profile are personal research projects, architected and developed entirely during non-duty status using personal infrastructure. They represent my independent work and passion for the craft, not official U.S. Government programs.
