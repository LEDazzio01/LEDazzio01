🔍 About Me

Principal-level Technical Program Manager and AI/ML Engineer with 18+ years leading secure, mission-critical programs in U.S. Air Force acquisitions. Proven record driving AI-native adoption, cybersecurity modernization, and multi-billion-dollar program delivery. Unique hybrid: technical depth (ML pipelines, explainable AI, security systems) plus executive-level influence. Trusted to brief senior military and international leaders, orchestrate cross-functional teams, and deliver secure, scalable, and responsible AI systems.


Technical Note: All engineering prototypes and code repositories featured on this profile are personal research projects, architected and developed entirely during non-duty status using personal infrastructure. They represent my independent work and passion for the craft, not official U.S. Government programs.
