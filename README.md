ðŸ”¥ About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer (and technical Program Manager) specializing in uncertainty modeling, structured prediction, and building ML systems that know what they don't know. My hands-on career spans defense-grade systems engineering and conformal prediction researchâ€”most recently demonstrated in Kaggleâ€™s Prediction Interval II competition, where I developed a nested, leak-free conformal pipeline with calibrated interval shrinkage and spatiotemporal cross-validation.

Certified as a Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (May 2025), I deliver production-grade models with a focus on empirical calibration, robustness, and scalable deployment. My toolkit includes CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, and advanced techniques like dynamic gamma tuning and conformal residual modeling for robust prediction intervals.

My analytical approach is inspired by the discipline and clarity of Elizabethan statecraftâ€”Queen Elizabeth I is my lodestar for leadershipâ€”reminding me that the best-calibrated models, like great decisions, require both precision and perspective.

ðŸŽ¯ Core Competencies
 - Conformal Prediction: Dynamic gamma tuning, non-symmetric calibration, fold-aware residual modeling
 - Spatiotemporal Validation: Cluster-aware cross-validation, fold-partitioned validation to control leakage
 - Feature Engineering: KNN-based comparables, hybrid quantile + residual pipelines, interval ensembling
 - ML Stack: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, pandas, Polars, PyTorch
 - Cloud & Infra: Google Cloud AI, GPU-accelerated pipelines, large-scale inference workflows

ðŸ§  Education & Certifications
 - Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer, 2025
 - M.S., Computer Science, Air Force Institute of Technology (Tau Beta Pi, 2017)
 - M.S., Computer Information Systems, Boston University (2009)
 - B.S., Computer and Information Science, University of Maryland (2007)

ðŸš€ Goals
 - Deliver decision-aware, causally grounded ML systems that thrive under uncertainty
 - Build transparent, high-throughput pipelines for complex, high-stakes domains
 - Mentor and collaborate with teams that value rigor, creativity, and domain-aware modeling

Open to connecting with fellow practitioners passionate about robust, interpretable ML and creative problem-solving.
