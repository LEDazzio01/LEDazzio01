🔍 About Me

Professional with an active Top-Secret clearance and 18+ years of technical experience within U.S. Air Force acquisitions. Expertise in Python, C++, Azure OpenAI, and Conformal Prediction. Proven track record of building fault-tolerant distributed simulations and secure GenAI agents with a focus on reliability and mathematical safety guarantees.

Technical Note: All engineering prototypes and code repositories featured on this profile are personal research projects, architected and developed entirely during non-duty status using personal infrastructure. They represent my independent work and passion for the craft, not official U.S. Government programs.
