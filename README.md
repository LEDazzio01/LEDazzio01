üî• About Me

I‚Äôm a Machine Learning Engineer and technical Program Manager specializing in robust, uncertainty-aware ML solutions‚Äîready to bring my passion for advanced modeling and AI transformation to London‚Äôs dynamic tech and data science community.

With 17+ years of hands-on experience spanning US defense systems, program leadership, and applied AI research, I thrive at the intersection of model precision, scalable engineering, and practical business impact. Most recently, I engineered leak-free, conformally calibrated prediction intervals for Kaggle‚Äôs Prediction Interval II competition, alongside a top-1% global Notebooks ranking and active progress toward Master status.

A certified Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (2025), I build production-ready ML pipelines with:
 - Empirical calibration
 - Spatiotemporal and cluster-aware validation
 - Scalable deployment across Google Cloud and modern MLOps stacks
 - My toolkit includes CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, and advanced ensembling for reliable, interpretable predictions. I‚Äôm inspired by rigorous, historically informed decision-making‚Äîthink Elizabethan statecraft meets modern AI engineering‚Äîbalancing precision with broader perspective.

üåç Looking Ahead

Actively seeking to relocate to London (UK) to join and help lead diverse teams solving impactful challenges in data science, retail, finance, sustainability, or technology innovation. I love collaborating with fellow practitioners who value rigor, creativity, and domain insight.

üéØ Core Competencies
 - Conformal Prediction: Dynamic gamma tuning, non-symmetric calibration, fold-aware modeling
 - Spatiotemporal Validation: Partitioned and cluster-based leakage control
 - Feature Engineering: KNN-based methods, hybrid quantile-residual pipelines, interval ensembling
 - ML Stack: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, pandas; PyTorch (learning, ongoing)
 - Cloud & Infra: Google Cloud AI, GPU-accelerated inference, large-scale pipelines

üß† Education & Certifications
 - Google Cloud Prof. ML Engineer, 2025
 - M.S., Computer Science, AFIT (Tau Beta Pi)
 - M.S., Computer Info Systems, Boston Univ.
 - B.S., Computer and Information Science, Univ. Maryland

üöÄ Goals
 - Deploy decision-aware, causally robust ML systems in real-world, high-stakes domains
 - Build transparent pipelines for complex analytics and business applications
 - Mentor and collaborate with teams committed to technical excellence and creative problem-solving
   
Open to connecting with London/UK employers, Kaggle community members, and anyone passionate about robust ML and impactful AI applications!
