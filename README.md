🔍 About Me

Senior Software Engineer and Systems Architect with 18+ years of experience specializing in high-performance distributed systems and safety-critical AI. Expertise in architecting low-latency
simulations, robust C++ storage engines, and reliable GenAI agents using C++, Rust, and Python. Proven track record of navigating strict regulatory environments to deliver production-grade software with rigorous mathematical safety guarantees and uncertainty quantification (Split Conformal Prediction). Passionate about building highly scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure at the intersection of HPC, DevSecOps, and MLOps.

Technical Note: All engineering prototypes and code repositories featured on this profile are personal research projects, architected and developed entirely during non-duty status using personal infrastructure. They represent my independent work and passion for the craft, not official U.S. Government programs.
