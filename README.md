🔍 About Me

Versatile Technology Leader with 17+ years of experience driving multi-billion-dollar acquisition programs, digital transformation, and data strategy in high-stakes national security environments. Unique dual-competency bridging Executive Program Management (Risk, Stakeholder Alignment, Global Operations) and Hands-on Technical Engineering (AI/ML, Data Analytics, Cloud Security). Proven track record of orchestrating distributed, cross-functional teams to deliver mission-critical capabilities under rigorous compliance standards. Expert in translating complex engineering requirements into strategic business value.


Technical Note: All engineering prototypes and code repositories featured on this profile are personal research projects, architected and developed entirely during non-duty status using personal infrastructure. They represent my independent work and passion for the craft, not official U.S. Government programs.
