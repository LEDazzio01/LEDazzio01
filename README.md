🔍 About Me

Technical Leader & Systems Engineer bringing 18+ years of architecting and delivering safety-critical defense systems in civilian service for the U.S. Air Force. Combines deep expertise in navigating strict regulatory environments with hands-on technical execution. Currently building production-focused AI safety frameworks and persistent LSM-Tree storage engines (Modern C++20, Python) and actively contributing to Microsoft's Agent Framework.




Technical Note: All engineering prototypes and code repositories featured on this profile are personal research projects, architected and developed entirely during non-duty status using personal infrastructure. They represent my independent work and passion for the craft, not official U.S. Government programs.
