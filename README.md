üî• About Me

I‚Äôm a Machine Learning Engineer and technical Program Manager specializing in robust, uncertainty-aware ML solutions‚Äîeager to bring my passion and expertise to London‚Äôs dynamic tech and data science scene. With 17+ years‚Äô experience across US defense, AI R&D, and program leadership, I focus on building ML systems where precision, scale, and real-world business value meet.

Recent highlights:
 - Engineered leak-free, conformally calibrated prediction intervals for Kaggle‚Äôs Prediction Interval II competition
 - Top 1% global Kaggle Notebooks ranking; progressing toward Master status
 - Certified Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer (2025)

Technical Focus:
 - Empirical calibration & conformal prediction (dynamic gamma tuning, non-symmetric calibration, fold-/cluster-aware validation)
 - Spatiotemporal validation with advanced leakage controls
 - Feature engineering: KNN-based, interval ensembling, quantile-residual pipelines

Tooling: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, pandas; PyTorch (actively learning)

Cloud/MLOps: Google Cloud AI platform, GPU-accelerated inference, scalable pipelines

Approach: Inspired by rigorous, historically informed decision-making (think: Elizabethan statecraft meets modern AI engineering), I design interpretable, production-ready pipelines that balance precision with long-term, system-wide impact.

üåç Looking Ahead

Relocating to London (UK) and open to leadership or senior hands-on roles in data science, retail, finance, sustainability, or innovative tech. I thrive in teams that value rigor, creativity, and domain expertise‚Äîand love collaborating with practitioners passionate about robust ML and impactful AI.
