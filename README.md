ðŸ”¥ About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and Program Manager with a passion for uncertainty modeling, structured prediction, and building systems that know what they don't know. My career spans defense-grade systems engineering and cutting-edge conformal prediction researchâ€”most recently showcased in Kaggleâ€™s Prediction Interval II competition, where I designed a hybrid quantile-residual pipeline with calibrated interval shrinkage and spatiotemporal cross-validation.

In May 2025, I earned my Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer certification, reflecting a commitment to production-grade ML practices. My toolbelt includes CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and scikit-learn, along with dynamic gamma tuning and conformal calibration layers that enforce empirical coverage while minimizing interval width.

Inspired by the discipline and clarity of Elizabethan statecraft (yes, Iâ€™m a history geekâ€”Queen Elizabeth I is my lodestar for leadership), I believe well-calibrated models, like great decisions, require both precision and perspective.

ðŸŽ¯ Core Competencies
- Conformal Prediction: Dynamic gamma tuning, non-symmetric calibration, fold-aware residual modeling
- Spatiotemporal Validation: Block bootstrap and cluster-aware CV to defeat leakage
- Feature Engineering: KNN-based comparables, hybrid quantile + residual pipelines, interval ensembling
- ML Stack: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, pandas, PyTorch (in progress)
- Infra + Acceleration: Google Cloud AI, GPU training pipelines, large-scale inference workflows

ðŸ§  Education & Certifications
- Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer, May 2025
- MS, Computer Science, Air Force Institute of Technology (Tau Beta Pi, 2017)
- MS, Computer Information Systems, Boston University (2009)
- BS, Computer & Information Science, University of Maryland (2007)

ðŸš€ Goals
- Deliver decision-aware, causally grounded ML systems that operate under uncertainty
- Build transparent, high-throughput pipelines for complex, high-stakes domains
- Mentor and collaborate across teams that value rigor, creativity, and domain-aware modeling
