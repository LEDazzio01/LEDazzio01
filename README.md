ðŸ”¥ About Me

Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer and Program Manager with a deep track record in high-performance modeling, conformal prediction, and real-world uncertainty estimation. I combine rigorous academic training with hands-on experience solving structured prediction problemsâ€”most recently in competitive environments like the Prediction Interval II Kaggle competition, where I built an ensemble conformal system with calibrated interval shrinkage and fold-aware spatial validation.

Certified as a Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer (May 2025), I bring a rare mix of systems engineering discipline and cutting-edge modeling skillsâ€”including CatBoost/XGBoost pipelines, dynamic gamma tuning, and conformal calibration layers for coverage-guaranteed prediction intervals.

My current work focuses on developing robust, deployable ML systems that go beyond point estimates and into decision-aware uncertainty modelingâ€”because in high-stakes domains, confidence isn't a luxury, it's a requirement.

ðŸŽ¯ Core Competencies
- Conformal Prediction: Fold-aware residual modeling, non-symmetric calibration, dynamic gamma optimization
- Spatiotemporal Validation: Block bootstrap & cluster-aware cross-validation to prevent leakage and overfitting
- Kaggle-Level Feature Engineering: KNN-derived comps, asymmetric interval ensembling, hybrid quantile + residual models
- ML Stack: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, sklearn, pandas, PyTorch (in progress)
- Infra + Acceleration: Google Cloud AI, GPU-accelerated model training, large-scale inference workflows

ðŸ§  Education & Certs
- GCP Professional Machine Learning Engineer, May 2025
- MS Computer Science, Air Force Institute of Technology (Tau Beta Pi, 2017)
- MS Computer Info Systems, Boston University (2009)
- BS Computer & Info Science, University of Maryland (2007)

ðŸš€ Goals
Iâ€™m building toward a role where I can:
- Deliver causally grounded, uncertainty-aware machine learning systems
- Architect fast, transparent pipelines that hold up under real-world pressure
- Mentor, collaborate, and contribute to the next generation of model-aware engineering
